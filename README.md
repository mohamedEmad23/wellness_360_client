## Media Requirements

### Hero Section Media

1. **Local Background Video**
   - `/public/videos/fitness-video.mp4` - High-quality fitness video for the hero section background
   - This video was downloaded from YouTube (original source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc7LUjbKBHw)
   - Benefits of using a local video file:
     - Faster loading times (no external API dependencies)
     - Works without an internet connection in development
     - Complete control over the video quality and compression
     - No YouTube branding or loading delays
   
2. **Fallback Image**
   - `/public/images/fitness-poster.jpg` - Static image that displays:
     - When the video is loading
     - If video playback fails
     - On mobile devices (for performance)
     - When JavaScript is disabled
     - Should match the video content for a seamless experience
   
3. **Implementation Details**
   - Direct video embedding using the HTML5 video tag with:
     - Autoplay and loop functionality
     - Muted by default (required for autoplay)
     - Responsive sizing with object-fit: cover
     - Error handling for graceful fallbacks
   - Mobile devices automatically receive the static image for better performance
   - A gradient overlay ensures text readability regardless of the background content
